# AMNHCTTools

This slicer extension has various module(s) that I find personally useful for micro-CT analysis of specimens scanned at AMNH.
Others may or may not find them useful, and I make no guarantees as to fitness for use or suitability for a particular
purpose.

The first module, Slice Area Plot, calculates the cross sectional area of all visible segments and plots these
values along a specified direction. It requires a relatively recent slicer version (at least 4.9, and at least a
nightly build from February or so) as it uses the newer plotting architecture.

New modules should follow as the need for analysis arises - I already have a couple in mind that I need to do.

Big thanks to Dr. Andras Lassoan for his initial example script on computing area, and for my many questions on
how to get it all working. Thanks also goes to the very active Slicer developers community, where I continue to learn
something nearly every day just by reading posts.
